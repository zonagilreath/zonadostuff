## Deployment (GitHub Pages)

This repo ships with a GitHub Actions workflow that builds and deploys the site to GitHub Pages.

If Pages isn't enabled yet:

1. Repo Settings → **Pages**
2. **Build and deployment** → Source: **GitHub Actions**

Then push to `main` (or the current feature branch) and the workflow will deploy.
